# Node v10.14 Project Setup

This repo contains a project setup and ready for Node development using latest JS features that I've encountered and enjoy.

- Node Dubnium (v 10.14.1) at time of writing
- Nodemon to reload project as changes are made in `./src/**/*.js`
- Babel version 7 giving latest JS features
- Jest for testing, configured to work through babel
- ESLint and Prettier ... hopefully playing nicely together
- config directory to set up values for different `NODE_ENV`

## Thanks To:

This project leveraged the install instructions of the libraries it depends on and uses code & patterns I've learned from watching Scott Moss and Kent Dodds teach.
